If you do not handle clay with your hands and do not put your soul into it, it will forever remain mud.
Perhaps this is magic, but after watching this issue, I also wanted to create art. I'll go and create something special.
How much inspiration is in your hands, you turn clay into art! I hope I did it too!!!
Not everyone can make such beauty from the products of the earth! Thanks for your talent! I take an example and learn to create the same beauty.
Well, how beautiful it is! It remains only to get inspiration and go create! Hope you enjoy my art.
