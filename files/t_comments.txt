You put your soul into every movement! I would like my movements to be as smooth, but for now I am making simpler content.
My knowledge is not as cool as yours, but I see and follow an example! Hopefully soon, I will be able to create the same.

Perhaps this is magic, but after watching this issue, I also wanted to create art. I'll go and create something special.
